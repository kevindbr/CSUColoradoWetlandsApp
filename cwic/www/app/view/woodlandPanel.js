        html: 'The Rocky Mountain Subalpine-Montane Riparian Woodland system is comprised of seasonally flooded conifer and aspen woodlands that line streams from the montane to subalpine zones. These are communities tolerant of periodic flooding and high water tables. Snowmelt moisture in this system may create shallow water tables or seeps for a portion of the growing season. Stands typically occur at elevations between 6,000â€“11,000 feet). This system is confined to specific riparian environments occurring on floodplains or terraces of rivers and streams, in V-shaped, narrow valleys and in canyons where there is cold-air drainage. Less frequently, occurrences are found in moderate-wide valley bottoms on large floodplains along broad, meandering rivers, and on pond or lake margins. Dominant tree species vary across the latitudinal range, although it usually includes subalpine fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>) and/or Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>). Other important species include Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), blue spruce (<i>Picea pungens</i>), quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and Rocky Mountain juniper (<i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>). Other woody species occasionally present but not usually dominant include thinleaf alder (<i>Alnus incana </i>sp. <i>tenuifolia</i>), white fir (<i>Abies concolor</i>), water birch (<i>Betula occidentalis</i>), lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>), and narrowleaf cottonwood (<i>Populus angustifolia</i>).',
