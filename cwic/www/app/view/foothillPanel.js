        html: 'The Rocky Mountain Lower Montane Riparian Woodland and Shrubland system is a linear system confined to floodplains, islands, sand or cobble bars, river terraces and streambanks in the lower montane to foothills regions from approximately 5,000-9,000 ft. In Colorado, it is primarily found in the western half of the state and along the foothills of the Front Range. Seasonal and episodic flooding is the primary driver of this ecosystem and is essential to maintaining a mosaic of plant associations. Vegetation is characterized by a mosaic of multiple communities that are tree-dominated with a diverse shrub component. A variety of plant associations are connected to this system, varying with elevation, stream gradient, floodplain width, and flooding events. Dominant trees may include box elder (<i>Acer negundo</i>), narrowleaf cottonwood (<i>Populus angustifolia</i>), plains cottonwood (<i>P. deltoides</i>), the hybrid lanceleaf cottonwood (<i>P. x acuminate</i>), balsam poplar (<i>P. balsamifera</i>  ssp. <i>  trichocarpa</i>), Douglas fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), blue spruce (<i>Picea pungens</i>), peachleaf willow (<i>Salix amygdaloides</i>), or Rocky Mountain juniper (<i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>).  Dominant shrubs include Rocky Mountain maple (<i>Acer glabrum</i>), thinleaf alder (<i>Alnus incana</i>), river birch (<i>Betula occidentalis</i>), red-osier dogwood (<i>Cornus sericea</i>), river hawthorn (<i>Crataegus rivularis</i>), stretchberry (<i>Forestiera pubescens</i>), chokecherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i>), skunkbush (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>), mountain willow (<i>Salix monticola</i>), Drummondâ€™s willow (<i>S. drummondiana</i>), narrowleaf willow (<i>S. exigua</i>), dewystem willow (<i>S. irrorata</i>), Pacific willow (<i>S. lucida</i>), buffaloberry (<i>Shepherdia argentea</i>), or snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos </i> spp.).  Exotic trees such as Russian olive (<i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i>) and tamarisk (<i>Tamarix </i> spp.) are common in some more disturbed stands. ',
