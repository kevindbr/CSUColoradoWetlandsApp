        html: 'Rocky Mountain Alpine-Montane Wet Meadows are herbaceous wetlands with mineral soils and a fluctuating water table that is at or below the ground surface. These wetlands occur at elevations from ~6,000â€“13,000 ft. Wet meadows occupy wet sites with low-velocity surface and subsurface flows, typically on flat areas or gentle slopes. They can occur as large meadows within mountain valleys, small meadows at the base of toeslope seeps, or as narrow strips bordering ponds, lakes, and streams. In the alpine, these wetlands typically occupy small depressions located below late-melting snow patches or snowbeds. Wet meadow soils are mineral, but may have a top layer of organic matter known as a histic epipedon. This system often occurs as a mosaic of several plant associations, often dominated by graminoids, although forb cover may be substantial in areas at higher elevations. Characteristic species at the highest elevations include mountain sedge (<i>Carex scopulorum</i>), sheep sedge (<i>C. illota</i>),  black alpine sedge (<i>C. nigricans</i>), Drummond\'s rush (<i>Juncus drummondii</i>), marsh marigold (<i>Caltha leptosepala</i>), and brook saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga odontoloma</i>). At subalpine to upper montane elevations, sites are often dominated by water sedge (<i>Carex aquatilis</i>) and beaked sedge (<i>C. utriculata</i>), either separately or in combination. Other common subalpine species include smallwing sedge (<i>C. microptera</i>), analogue sedge (<i>C. simulata</i>), tufted hairgrass (<i>Deschampsia cespitosa</i>), fewflower spikerush (<i>Eleocharis quinqueflora</i>), bluejoint reedgrass (<i>Calamagrostis canadensis</i>), heartleaf bittercress (<i>Cardamine cordifolia</i>), tall fringed bluebells (<i>Mertensia cilliata</i>), arrowleaf ragwort (<i>Senecio triangularis</i>), elephanthead lousewort (<i>Pedicularis groenlandica</i>), and large leaf avens (<i>Geum macrophyllum</i>). At mid to lower montane elevations, clustered field sedge (<i>Carex praegracilis</i>), Nebraska sedge (<i>C. nebrascensis</i>), woolly sedge (<i>C. pellita</i>), common spikerush (<i>Eleocharis palustris</i>), and mountain rush (<i>Juncus balticus</i> var. <i>montanus</i>) are typical dominants.
