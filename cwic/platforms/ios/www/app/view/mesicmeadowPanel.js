        html: 'The Rocky Mountain Subalpine-Montane Mesic Meadow system is restricted to sites from lower montane to subalpine where finely textured soils, snow deposition, or windswept dry conditions limit tree establishment. Many occurrences are small is size and are often found in mosaics with woodlands, more dense shrublands, or just below alpine communities. This system is typically found above 6,500 ft. in elevation. These communities occur on gentle to moderate-gradient slopes in relatively moist habitats. Though they are considered upland meadows, the soils are typically seasonally moist in the spring and dry out later in the growing season. These sites are not as wet as those found in Rocky Mountain Alpine-Montane Wet Meadow. Vegetation is typically forb-rich, with forbs often contributing more to overall herbaceous cover than graminoids. Some stands are comprised of dense grasslands, but the moist habitat promotes a rich forb component. Important taxa include daisies (<i>Erigeron</i> spp.), bluebells (<i>Mertensia</i> spp.), beardtongue (<i>Penstemon</i> spp.), bellflower (<i>Campanula</i> spp.), lupine (<i>Lupinus</i> spp.), goldenrod (<i>Solidago</i> spp.), licorice-root (<i>Ligusticum</i> spp.), meadow-rue (<i>Thalictrum</i> spp.), and valerian (<i>Valeriana</i> spp.). Important graminoids include tufted hairgrass (<i>Deschampsia caespitosa</i>), prairie Junegrass (<i>Koeleria macrantha</i>), perennial bromes (<i>Bromus</i> spp.), and a number of sedge species. Shrubs such as shrubby cinquefoil (<i>Dasiphora fruticosa</i> ssp. <i>floribunda</i>) and snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos</i> spp.) are occasional but not abundant. ',
