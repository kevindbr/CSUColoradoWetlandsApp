        html: 'The Western Great Plains Riparian system is found in the riparian areas of medium and small rivers and streams throughout the western Great Plains which includes eastern Coloradoâ€™s shortgrass prairie region. It includes primarily small, often narrow feeder streams that originate on the plains. This system is found on alluvial soils in highly variable landscape settings, from deep cut ravines to wide, braided streambeds. The smaller streams hydrologically tend to be flashy and may dry down completely for some portion of the year. The larger streams have a less well-developed floodplain than their main-stem counterparts (the South Platte and Arkansas Rivers), which are classified as Western Great Plains Floodplain systems. Water sources for this riparian system include snowmelt runoff, springs and summer rains. This system includes numerous smaller prairie rivers and streams that are often groundwater-fed, such as the Arikaree River and the Republican River. Communities within this system include riparian forests and shrublands, tallgrass and mixed grass wet meadows, herbaceous wetlands and gravel/sand flats. Riparian vegetation is primarily deciduous. Dominant species include plains cottonwood (<i>Populus deltoides</i>), willow (<i>Salix </i> spp.), silver sagebrush (<i>Artemisia cana </i> ssp. <i> cana</i>), western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>), switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>), vine mesquite (<i>Panicum obtusum</i>), sand dropseed (<i>Sporobolus cryptandrus</i>), little bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>), big bluestem (<i>Andropogon gerardii</i>), and yellow indiangrass (<i>Sorghastrum nutans</i>). Marsh communities may occur along or adjacent to portions of this system and may be characterized by plant species such as bulrush (<i>Schoenoplectus </i> spp.), spikerush (<i>Eleocharis </i> spp.), and other sedges (<i>Carex </i> spp.). These riparian systems are often subjected to hydrologic alteration, heavy grazing and/or agriculture and can be heavily degraded. Consequences include diminished ecosystem function, altered vegetation composition and structure and the invasion of non-native species, including tamarisk (<i>Tamarix </i> spp.), Russian olive (<i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i>), green ash (<i>Fraxinus pennsylvanica</i>) and less desirable grasses and forbs.',
