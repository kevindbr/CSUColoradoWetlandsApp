        html: 'The Western Great Plains Floodplain system occurs on the floodplains of medium and large rivers of the Western Great Plains. In Colorado, this system is more or less limited to the South Platte and the Arkansas Rivers. These are the perennial big rivers of the region with hydrologic dynamics largely driven by snowmelt in the mountains instead of local precipitation events. Periodic, intermediate flooding (every 5–25 years) that re-distributes alluvial soils is essential to the maintenance of this system. Plains floodplains are characterized by a linear mosaic of communities, some wetland and some upland, that are linked by soils and by the flooding regime. Dominant communities within this system include open gallery forests, dense shrublands along the water’s edge, open wet and mesic meadows and sparsely vegetated gravel and sand flats. Dominant woody species include Plains cottonwood (<i>Populus deltoides</i>) and willow (<i>Salix </i> spp.) species. Herbaceous cover is an important part of this system and is a mix of tallgrass species, including switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>) and big bluestem (<i>Andropogon gerardii</i>). Invasion of exotic species is one consequence of the anthropogenic alteration of the river and floodplain system, especially in the western part of the Great Plains. Non-native plant species include tamarisk (<i>Tamarix </i> spp.) and Russian olive (<i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i>) and less desirable or exotic grasses and forbs which displace native species. These areas have often been subjected to heavy grazing and/or agriculture and can be heavily degraded. Groundwater depletion and fire suppression has resulted in additional alterations to species composition and system function. In most cases, the majority of the wet meadow and prairie communities may be extremely degraded or extirpated from examples of this system.',
