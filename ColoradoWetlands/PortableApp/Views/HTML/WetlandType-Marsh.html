    <h1>MARSH</h1>
    <p>
        The North American Arid West Emergent Marsh system includes wetlands with permanent to semi-permanent standing water that support aquatic, submerged, and coarse emergent plants. Natural marshes may occur in depressions (ponds, kettle ponds), on lake fringes, or within riparian and floodplain areas as beaver ponds, backwater channels, oxbows, or sloughs. Marshes are frequently or continually inundated, with water depths up to 2 m. Water levels may be stable, or may fluctuate 1 m or more over the course of the growing season. Hydrologic inputs include direct precipitation, surface water inflows, and groundwater discharge. Marshes have distinctive soil characteristics that result from long periods of anaerobic conditions in the soils (e.g., gleyed soils, high organic content, redoximorphic features). The vegetation is characterized by herbaceous plants that are adapted to saturated soil conditions. Common emergent and floating vegetation includes species of bulrush (<i>Scirpus</i> and/or <i>Schoenoplectus</i>), cattail (<i>Typha</i>), rush (<i>Juncus</i>), pondweed (<i>Potamogeton</i>), smartweed (<i>Polygonum</i>), pondlily (<i>Nuphar</i>), and canarygrass (<i>Phalaris</i>). This system may also include areas of relatively deep water with floating-leaved plants such as duckweed (<i>Lemna</i>), and submerged and floating plants such as watermilfoil (<i>Myriophyllum</i>), hornwort (<i>Ceratophyllum</i>), and waterweed (<i>Elodea</i>).
