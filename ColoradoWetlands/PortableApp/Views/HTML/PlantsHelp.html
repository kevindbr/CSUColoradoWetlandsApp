            <h1><strong>HELP USING WETLAND PLANTS</strong></h1>
        </div>
        <p>The Wetland Plants Section of the app contains detailed information on 710 vascular plant species found in Colorado wetlands and riparian areas. The list can be sorted by Scientific Name, Common Name, Family, and Group. The list can be searched in many ways using the Search button from the main Plants Screen. Access a glossary of botanical terms by tapping the Terms button on the main Plants Screen.</p>
        <p>To view the full description of a plant, tap the entry from either the full list or the results of a search. Each description is broken into six pages, which are described below. You can move between pages using buttons at the bottom of the screen.</p>
        
        <div class="section_header">IMAGES</div>
        <p>Each species includes photos and/or illustrations that highlight the most diagnostic characteristics of the plant. Images can be browsed by swiping to the left or right. Images were compiled from numerous different sources, including Colorado photographers, internet-based photo databases, genera-specific photo collections of herbarium specimens, and botanical illustrators.</p>
        
        <div class="section_header">GENERAL DESCRIPTION</div>
        <p>The General Description page includes a range of information relevant to each species, as defined below.</p>
        <p><b>Scientific Name:</b>  USDA-NRCS PLANTS National Database is the primary nomenclature used for scientific names.  This nomenclature differs in some instances from state-based floras (e.g., Weber and Wittmann 2012, Ackerfield 2012), but is best for comparing across state borders and between various national datasets.</p>
        <p><b>Family:</b> Family names used in the app are derived from PLANTS National Database. If a species is treated in a different family in one of the state floras or in Flora of North America, the alternate family name is listed in parenthesis.</p>
        <p><b>Common Name:</b> Common names are generally derived from PLANTS National Database. In cases where there is more than one common name, both are listed.</p>
        <p><b>Synonyms:</b> Major synonyms are listed for each species. A special effort was made to include all names used by Weber and Wittmann (2012), Ackerfield (2012), and the most recent Flora of North America treatments (Flora of North America 1993+).</p>
        <p><b>USDA PLANTS Symbol:</b> The unique alpha-numeric symbol for each species used within PLANTS National Database. The symbols begin with the first two letters of the genus name and the first two letters of the species name, followed by the first letter of the subspecies or varieties, if applicable. If the letters in any code are the same for more than one taxon, a number is included at the end of the code to make each code unique.</p>
        <p><b>ITIS TSN:</b> The Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) Taxonomic Serial Number (TSN). Like the USDA PLANTS Symbol, this is a unique numeric code used to differentiate species and is used by many national and international agencies.</p>
        <p><b>Federal Status:</b> Notes whether a species is listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act or considered sensitive by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or U.S. Forest Service (USFS).</p>
        <p><b>Global / State Ranks:</b> From the Natural Heritage Network, which ranks the rarity of species on a Global (G) and Subnational/State (S) level. Basic ranks are shown in the table below. State ranks are included for all six states within EPA Region 8 (CO, WY, UT, MT, SD, ND).</p>
        <table>
            <thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>Critically Imperiled (typically 5 or fewer occurrences or less than 1,000 individuals)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>Imperiled (typically 6 to 20 occurrences or between 1,000 and 3,000 individuals)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Vulnerable to Extirpation (typically 21 to 100 occurrences or between 3,000 and 10,000 individuals)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>Apparently Secure (usually more than 100 occurrences and more than 10,000 individuals)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>Demonstrably Widespread, Abundant, and Secure (typically with considerably more than 100 occurrences and more than 10,000 individuals)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>NR</td><td>Not Ranked (not enough information is available on which to base a rank)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>NA</td><td>Not Applicable (rarity ranking is not applicable because the species is not native to the state)</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><b>C-Value:</b> The C-Value is the "coefficient of conservatism," which represents the estimated probability that a species occurs in a landscape that is either pristine or disturbed. C-values range from 0–10 with 0 reserved for non-native species. See table below for an explanation of C-values and example species. The average C-value of a plant community assesses the degree of “naturalness” based on the presence or absence of conservative species and provides a powerful and relatively easy assessment of biotic integrity. C-values for Colorado species were assigned by a panel of botanical experts.</p>
        <table>
            <thead><tr><th>C-Values</th><th>Interpretation</th><th>Examples (C-Value)</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>Non-native species. Very prevalent in new ground or non-natural areas.</td><td>Watercress (<em>Nasturtium officinale</em>) (0)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1-3</td><td>Commonly found in non-natural areas.</td><td>Water plantain (<em>Alisma trivale</em>) (3)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4-6</td><td>Equally found in natural and non-natural areas.</td><td>Woolly sedge (<em>Carex pellita</em>) (6)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>7-9</td><td>Obligate to natural areas but can sustain some habitat degradation.</td><td>Blue-eyed grass (<em>Sisyrinchium pallidum)</em> (7)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>10</td><td>Obligate to high quality natural areas (relatively unaltered from pre-European settlement).</td><td>Round-leaf sundew (<em>Drosera rotundifolia)</em> (10)</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> Indicates if a species is typically annual, biennial, perennial, or some combination of the three. This information is derived from PLANTS National Database.</p>
        <p><b>Native Status:</b> Denotes whether a plant is considered native, non-native, or, in limited cases, both native and non-native. Native status used in this guide is derived from PLANTS National Database, which largely considers whether a plant is native to the contiguous United States. There is considerable debate among taxonomic experts on the origin of certain plant species. Where there is debate about whether a species is native to Colorado, we have included that information in comments on the Ecology page.</p>
        <p><b>Weed Status:</b> Notes all species on the Noxious Weed List A, B and C and the Watch List as designated by the Colorado Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p><b>Wetland Status:</b> The likelihood that a particular plant occurs in a wetland or upland. Wetland indicator ratings are determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and are specific to the three regions within Colorado (AW: Arid West, WM: Western Mountains, GP: Great Plains). See map and table below for an explanation of each rating.</p>

        <p><b>Key Characteristics:</b> Perhaps the most important part of this page, the key characteristics include up to five bullets that detail the most important and distinguishing characteristics of the species. In general, the first bullet describes overall plant size, plant habit, stem characteristics, and rooting structure. The second bullet describes the most important features of the leaves, including the size, shape, position on the plant, presence of hairs, etc. If there is more than one type of leaf, both are described in detail. Remaining bullets describe important features of the inflorescence, flowers and flower parts, and seeds. The key characteristics vary by family and genus, as each has particular characteristics of importance.</p>

        <div class="section_header">SIMILAR SPECIES</div>
        <p>The Similar Species page includes look-alikes that could be easily mistaken for the main species. If a similar species has a full description in the App, it will appear in an interactive list. If it is not included in the app, it is described in brief in General Comments above the list and the USDA PLANTS Code, Wetland Indicator Status, and ITIS TSN are provided. General Comments may also include distinguishing characteristics of two or more subspecies or distinguishing characteristics of the entire genus.</p>

        <div class="section_header">ECOLOGY</div>
        <p>The Ecology page includes information about the habitat and ecological preferences of the species, as well as general comments and icons representing animals groups that typically use the species.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Ecology:</b> The general habitat and ecology of the species, including the general region of the state where it occurs. If the species is known only from a handful of counties, they are mentioned specifically.</p>
        <p><b>Comments:</b> Comments includes a range of noteworthy information about the species. This information includes facts about wildlife use, ethnobotanical use, origins of the plant name, and evolutionary strategies of the plant or plant family. In cases where there is debate over nomenclature or over whether the plant is native to Colorado, that information is also included in comments.</p>
        <p><b>Ecological Systems:</b> A list of Ecological Systems (wetland types) in which the species is likely to occur. Ecological Systems are dynamic assemblages or complexes of plant communities that occur together on the landscape are tied together by similar ecological processes, underlying abiotic environmental factors or gradients and form a readily identifiable unit on the ground.</p>
        <p><b>Animal Use:</b> Along with animal use described in comments, the animal use icons are a quick reference for which animal and bird groups use each plant species.</p>
