            <h1><strong>HOW TO USE THE APP</strong></h1>
        </div>
        <p>The Colorado Wetlands App places in-depth information about Colorado wetlands right on your smartphone or tablet. The app includes three main sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Wetland Plants:</strong>
                Detailed descriptions and photos of over 720 plant species found in Colorado’s wetlands and riparian areas. Tap Wetland Plants from the Home Screen to search and explore the species descriptions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Wetland Maps:</strong>
                Access to digital National Wetland Inventory maps for Colorado. Tap Wetland Maps from the Home Screen for an interactive mapping tool to explore wetlands mapped in your area. The Wetland Maps screen can also be used to search wetland plants potentially found at your location.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Wetland Types:</strong>
                Short descriptions of the major wetland and riparian types in Colorado. The wetland types described in this app are based on NatureServe Ecological Systems and are modified for Colorado.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div id="header">
            <h1><strong>HELP USING WETLAND PLANTS</strong></h1>
        </div>
        <p>The Wetland Plants Section opens with a list of plants. Users can SORT the list by Scientific Name, Common Name, Family, and Group. You can also SEARCH the list by many criteria using the button at the top of the main Plants Screen. In addition, users can create a list of FAVORITES, which can be accessed from the main screen. A GLOSSARY of botanical terms is found at the bottom of the main screen, as well as a way to switch to the MAPS screen.</p>
        <p>To view the full description of a plant, tap the entry from either the full list or the results of a search. Each description is broken into the five pages described below. You can move between pages using buttons at the bottom (iPhone) or top (Android) of the screen. From within a full description, you can add a plant to your FAVORITES by tapping the star next to the name.</p>

        <div class="section_header">IMAGES</div>
        <p>Each species includes photos and/or illustrations that highlight the most diagnostic characteristics of the plant. Images can be browsed by swiping to the left or right. Images were compiled from numerous different sources, including Colorado photographers, internet-based photo databases, genera-specific photo collections of herbarium specimens, and botanical illustrators.</p>

        <div class="section_header">INFO</div>
        <p>The Info page includes a range of information relevant to each species.</p>
        <p><b>NOMENCLATURE</b></p>
        <p><b>Scientific Name:</b>  USDA-NRCS PLANTS National Database is the primary nomenclature used for scientific names.  This nomenclature differs in some instances from state-based floras (e.g., Weber and Wittmann 2012, Ackerfield 2012), but is best for comparing across state borders and between various national datasets.</p>
        <p><b>Family:</b> Family names used in the app are derived from PLANTS National Database. If a species is treated in a different family in one of the state floras or in Flora of North America, the alternate family name is listed in parenthesis.</p>
        <p><b>Common Name:</b> Common names are generally derived from PLANTS National Database. In cases where there is more than one common name, both are listed.</p>
        <p><b>Synonyms:</b> Major synonyms are listed for each species. A special effort was made to include all names used by Weber and Wittmann (2012), Ackerfield (2012), and the most recent Flora of North America treatments (Flora of North America 1993+).</p>
        <p><b>USDA PLANTS Symbol:</b> The unique alpha-numeric symbol for each species used within the PLANTS National Database. The symbols begin with the first two letters of the genus name and the first two letters of the species name, followed by the first letter of the subspecies or varieties, if applicable. If the letters in any code are the same for more than one taxon, a number is included at the end of the code to make each code unique.</p>
        <p><b>ITIS TSN:</b> The Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) Taxonomic Serial Number (TSN). Like the USDA PLANTS Symbol, this is a unique numeric code used to differentiate species and is used by many national and international agencies.</p>
        <p><b>CONSERVATION STATUS</b></p>
        <p><b>Federal Status:</b> Notes whether a species is listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act or considered sensitive by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or U.S. Forest Service (USFS).</p>
        <p><b>Global / State Ranks:</b> From the Natural Heritage Network, which ranks the rarity of species on a Global (G) and Subnational/State (S) level. Basic ranks are shown in the table below. State ranks are included for all six states within EPA Region 8 (CO, WY, UT, MT, SD, ND).</p>
        <table>
            <thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>Critically Imperiled (typically 5 or fewer occurrences or less than 1,000 individuals)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>Imperiled (typically 6 to 20 occurrences or between 1,000 and 3,000 individuals)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Vulnerable to Extirpation (typically 21 to 100 occurrences or between 3,000 and 10,000 individuals)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>Apparently Secure (usually more than 100 occurrences and more than 10,000 individuals)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>Demonstrably Widespread, Abundant, and Secure (typically with considerably more than 100 occurrences and more than 10,000 individuals)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>NR</td><td>Not Ranked (not enough information is available on which to base a rank)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>NA</td><td>Not Applicable (rarity ranking is not applicable because the species is not native to the state)</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><b>BIOLOGY</b></p>
        <p><b>C-Value:</b> The C-Value is the "coefficient of conservatism," which represents the estimated probability that a species occurs in a landscape that is either pristine or disturbed. C-values range from 0–10 with 0 reserved for non-native species. See table below for an explanation of C-values and example species. The average C-value of a plant community assesses the degree of “naturalness” based on the presence or absence of conservative species and provides a powerful and relatively easy assessment of biotic integrity. C-values for Colorado species were assigned by a panel of botanical experts.</p>
        <table>
            <thead><tr><th>C-Values</th><th>Interpretation</th><th>Examples (C-Value)</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>Non-native species. Very prevalent in new ground or non-natural areas.</td><td>Watercress (<em>Nasturtium officinale</em>) (0)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1-3</td><td>Commonly found in non-natural areas.</td><td>Water plantain (<em>Alisma trivale</em>) (3)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4-6</td><td>Equally found in natural and non-natural areas.</td><td>Woolly sedge (<em>Carex pellita</em>) (6)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>7-9</td><td>Obligate to natural areas but can sustain some habitat degradation.</td><td>Blue-eyed grass (<em>Sisyrinchium pallidum)</em> (7)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>10</td><td>Obligate to high quality natural areas (relatively unaltered from pre-European settlement).</td><td>Round-leaf sundew (<em>Drosera rotundifolia)</em> (10)</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> Indicates if a species is typically annual, biennial, perennial, or some combination of the three. This information is derived from PLANTS National Database.</p>
        <p><b>Native Status:</b> Denotes whether a plant is considered native, non-native, or, in limited cases, both native and non-native. Native status used in this guide is derived from PLANTS National Database, which largely considers whether a plant is native to the contiguous United States. There is considerable debate among taxonomic experts on the origin of certain plant species. Where there is debate about whether a species is native to Colorado, we have included that information in comments on the Ecology page.</p>
        <p><b>Weed Status:</b> Notes all species on the Noxious Weed List A, B and C and the Watch List as designated by the Colorado Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p><b>Wetland Indicator Status:</b> The likelihood that a particular plant occurs in a wetland or upland. Wetland indicator ratings are determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and are specific to the three regions within Colorado (AW: Arid West, WM: Western Mountains, GP: Great Plains). See map and table below for an explanation of each rating.</p>

        <p><b>KEY CHARACTERISTICS</b></p>
        <p>Perhaps the most important part of this page, the key characteristics include up to five bullets that detail the most important and distinguishing characteristics of the species. In general, the first bullet describes overall plant size, plant habit, stem characteristics, and rooting structure. The second bullet describes the most important features of the leaves, including the size, shape, position on the plant, presence of hairs, etc. If there is more than one type of leaf, both are described in detail. Remaining bullets describe important features of the inflorescence, flowers and flower parts, and seeds. The key characteristics vary by family and genus, as each has particular characteristics of importance.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The Wetland Maps Section allows users to interactively explore up-to-date digital National Wetland Inventory (NWI) mapping for Colorado. When you first enter the mapping screen, your device will center the mapping at your general location. You can zoom in or out using either your finger or the buttons on the top left portion of the screen. You can also move the view to any location in Colorado. To reset the view, simply click the refresh button. At the bottom of the screen, the Key button will bring up a key to the NWI codes used for labeling polygons. The Legend button will bring up a color coded legend to the mapping’s color scheme.</p>
        <p>One of the best features of the Wetland Mapping section is the Plant button. Clicking this button will bring up a list of wetland plants potentially found in your general location, as determined by county and current elevation +/- 500 feet. The list is filtered based on your GPS location, not the extent of your view, so remember that if you move the view away from your current location. The filtered plant list allows users to become familiar with common wetland plants found in their neighborhood or when out hiking!</p>

        <div class="section_header">BACKGROUND ON NWI MAPPING</div>
        <p>The National Wetland Inventory (NWI) has been producing wetland maps and geospatial wetland data for the United States since the mid-1970s. NWI is headed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and relies on contributions from many collaborators to produce high quality wetland mapping from the nation. Colorado Natural Heritage Program (CNHP) and Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) have worked closely with NWI since 2008 to create a complete digital map of wetlands for Colorado. Much of the mapping displayed in this app was originally created in the 1970s and 1980s as paper maps based on coarse air photography and only recently converted to digital data by CNHP and CPW. However, CNHP has created updated mapping in many areas of the state, included the northern Front Range and Park County.</p>
