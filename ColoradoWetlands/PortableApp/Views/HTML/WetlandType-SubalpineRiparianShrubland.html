    <h1>SUBALPINE RIPARIAN SHRUBLAND</h1>
    <p>
        Subalpine riparian shrublands are seasonally flooded shrublands that occurs in a variety of geomorphic settings and with variable community structure. These shrublands often form a mosaic of shrub- and herb-dominated vegetation types and may occur as narrow bands of shrubs lining streambanks and alluvial terraces; as terraces in narrow to wide, low-gradient valley bottoms and floodplains with sinuous stream channels; or as extensive willow carrs in broad, hummocky floodplains and subalpine valleys. Occurrences can also be found around seeps, fens, and isolated springs on hillslopes away from valley bottoms. Beaver activity is often associated with the development of these shrubland systems and can profoundly change vegetation structure and alter hydrologic regimes. This system often occurs as a mosaic of multiple communities that are shrub- and herb-dominated and includes willow-dominated, snowmelt-fed basins in the alpine that feed into first order streams. The dominant shrubs reflect the large elevational gradient and include thinleaf alder (<i> Alnus incana<i>), resin birch (<i> Betula glandulosa<i>), river birch (<i> Betula occidentalis<i>), red-osier dogwood (<i> Cornus sericea<i>), and several species of willow (<i> Salix bebbiana, S. boothii, S. brachycarpa, S. drummondiana, S. eriocephala, S. geyeriana, S. monticola, S. planifolia, <i> and <i> S. wolfii<i>). Generally the upland vegetation surrounding these riparian systems are of either conifer or aspen forests.
