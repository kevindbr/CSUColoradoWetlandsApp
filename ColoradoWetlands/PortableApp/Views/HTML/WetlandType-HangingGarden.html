    <h1>HANGING GARDEN</h1>
    <p>
        The Colorado Plateau Hanging Garden system occurs throughout the canyons of the Colorado Plateau region along major river drainages and their tributaries. Climate in the Colorado Plateau region is arid, precipitation is low and temperatures can be extreme. Infrequent seeps and springs along xeric canyon walls support hydrophytic habitat called hanging gardens. Hanging gardens are island-like habitats dominated by mesophytic-hydrophytic plant communities growing on seeps on the xeric canyon walls of the Colorado Plateau. These gardens are supported by perennial water sources (seeps) that form pocketed wetlands and draping vegetation across wet cliff faces. Three main garden types exist: alcove, terrace, or windowblind. Each is determined by the nature of the geological formation and the presence or absence of joint systems. Hanging gardens occupy all exposures of the canyon walls, but sites are shaded for much of each day. Temperature and humidity in these sites is cooler and moister and relatively stable compared to the surrounding environment. Most hanging gardens are dominated by herbaceous plants, and a number of these are endemic to this region. Common species include southern maidenhair fern (<i>Adiantum capillus-veneris</i>), northern maidenhair fern (<i>Adiantum pedatum</i>), Eastwood’s monkeyflower (<i>Mimulus eastwoodiae</i>), common large monkeyflower (<i>Mimulus guttatus</i>), Purpus’ sullivantia (<i>Sullivantia hapemanii</i>), Rydberg’s thistle (<i>Cirsium rydbergii</i>), and several species of columbine (<i>Aquilegia </i> spp.). This system includes hanging gardens of the Utah High Plateau ecoregion, which differ somewhat in geology and species composition from those of the Colorado Plateau to the south.
