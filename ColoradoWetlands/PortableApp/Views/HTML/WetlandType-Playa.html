    <h1>PLAYA</h1>
    <p>
        Playas occur within eastern Colorado’s shortgrass prairie region. These closed depressions are characterized by clay-lined pond bottoms, shallow topography, and hydrology that is fed strictly from precipitation and local runoff. These wetlands are most often isolated from groundwater sources and do not have extensive watersheds, although they are often occur within a larger complex of depressional wetlands. These systems experience drawdowns during drier seasons and years, and are replenished by heavy rains. Playa vegetation commonly grows in successive zones that are associated with inundation patterns and water levels, with the most hydrophytic species occurring in the wetland center where ponding persists the longest. Plant composition and diversity varies from site to site depending on how often it wets, surrounding and localized land use, and micro-topography. Common vegetation in the wetter, deeper depressions or zones include needle spikerush (<i>Eleocharis acicularis<i>), pale sprikerush (<i>Eleocharis macrostachya<i>), foxtail barley (<i>Critesion jubatum<i>), along with common forbs such as spreading yellowcress (<i>Rorippa sinuata<i>), wedgeleaf (<i>Phyla cunefolia<i>), and woolyleaf bur ragweed (<i>Ambrosia grayi<i>). Shallower sites or zones, or sites that do not wet as frequently, are often occupied by western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum smithii<i>) and buffalo grass (<i>Buchloe dactyloides<i>).  It is not uncommon for playas in eastern Colorado to exhibit barren, cracked ground between wetting cycles. Threats to system integrity include hydrologic changes, overgrazing, and conversion to agricultural use.
