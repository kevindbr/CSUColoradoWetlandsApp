    <h1>GREASEWOOD FLATS</h1>
    <p>
        The Inter-Mountain Basins Greasewood Flats system occurs throughout the Intermountain West and extends onto the western Great Plains and central Montana. Greasewood flats are a large patch system confined to specific environments defined by hydrologic regime, soil salinity and soil texture. This system typically occurs near drainages on stream terraces and flats or may form rings around more sparsely vegetated playas. Sites typically have saline soils, a shallow water table and flood intermittently, but remain dry for most of the growing season. However, the water table remains high enough to maintain vegetation, despite salt accumulations. This system usually occurs as a mosaic of multiple communities of open to moderately dense shrublands dominated or codominated by black greasewood (<i>Sarcobatus vermiculatus</i>). Other shrubs that may be present or codominant include four-winged saltbush (<i>Atriplex canescens</i>), shadscale (<i>Atriplex confertifolia</i>), Gardner’s saltbush (<i>Atriplex gardneri</i>), Wyoming sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata </i> ssp. <i> wyomingensis</i>), Basin big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata </i> ssp. <i> tridentata</i>), Plains silver sagebrush (<i>Artemisia cana </i> ssp. <i> cana</i>), or winterfat (<i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i>). Occurrences are often surrounded by mixed salt desert scrub or big sagebrush shrublands. The herbaceous layer, if present, is usually dominated by graminoids. There may be inclusions of alkali sacaton (<i>Sporobolus airoides</i>), western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>), inland saltgrass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>), sand reedgrass (<i>Calamovilfa longifolia</i>), Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>), Nuttall’s alkali grass (<i>Puccinellia nuttalliana</i>), or creeping spikerush (<i>Eleocharis palustris</i>) herbaceous types.
