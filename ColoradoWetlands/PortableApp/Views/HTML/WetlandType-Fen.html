        Rocky Mountain Subalpine-Montane Fens are groundwater-fed, peat-accumulating wetlands with perennially saturated soils. This system is confined to specific environments where groundwater discharge is sufficient to generate peat accumulation of at least 40 cm. Fens form in natural depressions (basin fens) or at the base of slopes where groundwater intercepts the soil surface (slope fens). Fens are often classified by water chemistry and floristic composition into the categories of rich fens, intermediate fens, and poor fens. Fens often occur as a mosaic of several plant associations and can support numerous rare species and community types. The most common dominants include water sedge (<i>Carex aquatilis</i>) and beaked sedge (<i>C. utriculata</i>), often accompanied by a diversity of other sedge species (<i>Carex illota, C. limosa, C. simulata, C. buxbaumii </i>and others) as well as spikerushes (<i>Eleocharis</i> spp.), bog sedges (<i>Kobresia </i>spp.), cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum </i>spp.), and rushes (<i>Juncus </i>spp.). Common forbs include elephanthead lousewort (<i>Pedicularis groenlandica</i>), redpod stonecrop (<i>Rhodiola rhodantha</i>), marsh marigold (<i>Caltha leptosepala</i>), and felwort (<i>Swertia perennis</i>). Sites can contain a woody component dominated by shrubs (<i>Salix </i>spp. and <i>Betula glandulosa</i>) or coniferous trees (<i>Picea engelmannii </i>or <i>Pinus contorta</i>). Bryophyte diversity is generally high and includes brown mosses and sphagnum (<i>Sphagnum </i>spp.).
